        <p>The Chevrolet Corvette (C8) is the eighth generation of the Corvette sports car manufactured by American automobile manufacturer Chevrolet. It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model's introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.</p>

        <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
        <p>Following several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM's first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7.[10] As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm).[11] The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov "Father of the Corvette") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.</p>

        <h2><b>E-Ray</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The E-Ray performance hybrid version of the C8 Corvette was unveiled on January 17, 2023. Similar to the Grand Sport model from the previous C7 generation, a significant portion of the Z06 body is reused for the E-Ray with different badging. Also, 21" rear and 20" front wheel sizes are ported from the Z06 with some unique wheel options for the E-Ray. The 6.2L engine, DCT transmission, and performance exhaust components are reused from the C8 Stingray model. Performance hybrid 1.9 kWh battery assembly, electric motor drive assembly, regenerative braking, hybrid electronics, and hybrid cooling system are new to the E-Ray model. The E-Ray entered production as a 2024 model year Corvette. At initial product launch, it was the quickest production Corvette ever made, as well as the first with all wheel drive, and the first performance hybrid.</p>
