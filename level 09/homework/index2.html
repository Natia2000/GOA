    <center><h2><b>What is metacognition?</b></h2></center>
    <center><p style= "text-align: justify;"> Metacognition is the ability to examine the process of thoughts and feelings. This ability encourages learners to understand how they learn best. It also helps them to develop self-awareness skills that will help them in the future. 

        In short, metacognition is the process of thinking about your own thinking and learning. It differs from normal thought because it is intentional. 
        
        Here are some examples of metacognition: 
        
        A pupil learns about what things help him or her to remember facts, names, and events. 
        A pupil learns about his or her own style of learning. 
        A pupil learns about which strategies are most effective for solving problems.</p></center>
